	A GTK Smith Chart Calculator for RF impedance matching

gsmc is a simple smith chart calculator used for automatic calculation in
radio frequency impedance matching.
Many good program doing this job are available for non free OS or are non
free themself; so getting what I retain the best features from each of
thes that I've seen in the past I decided to write one and release it under 
GNU/GPL license.

gsmc is under development: help is needed and welcomed; in my hope it 
will be the first part of a suite of rf designing tool all to be released
under GPL. Write me if you are interested; my experience in coding is
modest, neither I have knolwedge in building up large and distributed
software project.

Prior to gsmc I wrote xsmc a very similar program that run under X and use
direct Xlib call, his aspect is not particular user friendly.

To use gsmc read the manual (man gsmc), should be enough...

Have nice matching!
