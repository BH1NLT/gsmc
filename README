	A GTK Smith Chart Calulator for RF impedance matching

gsmc is a simple smith chart calculator used for automatic calculation in
radio frequency impedance matching.
Many good program for doing this job are available for non free OS or are non
free themself; so getting what I retain the best characteristic from each of
thes that I've seen in the past I decided to write one and release it under 
GNU/GPL license.

Program is under development: help is needed and welcomed; in my hope it 
will be the first part of a suite of rf designing tool all to be released
under GPL. Write me if you are interested; my experience in write software
is limitated, neither I have knolwedge in building up large and distributed
software project.

Prior to gsmc I wrote xsmc a very similar program that run under X and use
direct Xlib call, his aspect is not particular user friendly.

For using gsmc reading the manual (man gsmc) should be enough...

Have nice matching!
