.SH NAME
gsmc \- A GTK Smith Chart Calculator for RF impedance matching


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gsmc

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gsmc
is a GTK application that allows one to do all the calculation usually done on
a Smith Chart.
It permits one to make calculation for network composed by resistor,
capacitor, inductance, and transmission line (also as stub).
Network topology is limited to series, parallel and as trasmissive
for transmission line. No series connection are allowed in parallel
branch, neither parallel connection in series branch.
Transmission line can be placed as quadrupole or as a parallel or
series stub, either opened or shorted at the other end.

Calculation procedure starts with setting the initial impedance to be
matched, next network elements are added and tuned to obtain the
desidered impedance value.

The network so obtained can be saved in spice format for other analysis;
current work can be saved for successive retrieve.

The initial (start) impedance is thought as "the load" so when
adding a transmission line placed as a quadrupole rotation is
clockwise, going "toward generator"; generator is placed after the
last network element, as can be seen from spice output.

.SH INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
.B gsmc
is a menu based GTK application with as much as possible accelerators
and mnemonics. Nearly all the command can to be issued as a single

be used extensively.

.B "DIALOG WIN"

For operation that requires data entry a widget is created; it is
composed by an text entry field and optionally some radio button to
chose the format of data entry.

The format for data entry can be a single number, or a more complex
string. First of all every number can be supplied using standard prefix
for unit of measure i.e.:
.RS
.IP a
(atto) 1e-18
.IP f 
(femto) 1e-15
.IP p 
(pico) 1e-12
.IP n 
(nano) 1e-9
.IP u 
(micro) 1e-6
.IP m 
(milli) 1e-3
.IP k 
(kilo) 1e3
.IP M 
(mega) 1e6
.IP G 
(giga) 1e9
.IP T 
(tera) 1e12
.RE
Note that for spice output format mega is written as MEG instead of M,
that will be otherwise recognized by spice as milli.
Unit of measure are not allowed to be in the text entered.

Where a complex number is required both the rectangular and the polar
format are recognized: the former can be supplied as '12.3-j456m'
while the latter can be supplied as '34.2 145' meaning a modulus of
34.2 with a phase of 145 degrees. If the complex number is purely
imaginary only something like 'j82' can be supplied, while if
imaginary part is zero a single number can be given. Imaginary operator
can be issued as 'i' as well as 'j'.

.SH DATA PRESENTATION
The single window of
.B gsmc
is divided in four parts:
.TP
.BI \-
The Smith chart itself in the upper left portion, where arcs and
constant circle are drawn.

.TP
.BI \-
The vertical bar on the right of the Smith chart, where initial, final
and cursor impedance are presented together general data.

.TP
.BI \-
The horizontal bar on the bottom of Smith chart where the network
element are listed.

.TP
.BI \-
The portion in the lower right portion, for future use...


.SH EXAMPLE OF USE
Let's try a simple example to understand how
.B gsmc
work. Suppose to have a load of 10-j35ohm to be matched to 50+j0ohm at
an operating frequency of 15.5MHz and we can use only concentrated
reactive elements, i.e. inductances and capacitors.

So start with setting operating frequency: press 'f' and a dialog win
will appear. Type in the string '15.5M' and then press enter. Now in the
vertical bar the frequency entered is displayed.

Next set the start point impedance: press 's' and a dialog win will
appear with the title "Start Point"; select the format for start point
either clicking the "Z" radio button or using the mnemonic via Mod+Z.
Now the impedance can be entered as the string '10-j35' followed by
enter. The starting point is now displayed as a small circle.


The network has now to be constructed: let start with a series
inductance of 800nH, so press 'l' and next introduce the value as '800n',
be sure that "Series" radio button is selected before pressing
enter. TAB and Shift+TAB is useful to move across items in dialog win
without leave hands from keyboard.
This value is really too large, use Shift+Left cursor to reduce a
bit. Up to where? Let's help you displaying the admittance constant
circles pressing "Ctrl+2", the arc should arrive to the G=1 circle
(also called the mirror circle), it's around 546nH.

Now add a capacitor in parallel connection, saying of 200pF: press 'c'
and insert the string '200p' and select Parallel either with mouse or
with "Mod+p". Now the admittance circles may confuse, remove it by
pressing "Ctrl+2" again. The value of 200pF is too small, enlarge it
by pressing Shift+Left cursor up to get the end point near to the
chart's center. The point reached with 429pF has nearly zero imaginary
but is 43ohm of real part instead of 50ohm.

So back to the inductance and try to modify it, with Shift+Cursor up
move to the first component and then try to change the inductance value by
pressing cursor left and right. The changes are too large and 50+j0
cannot be reached. So press "Mod+Cursor down" and the "tunestep" value shown
in the vertical bar is reduced from 10% to 5%, try again to use Shift+Cursors
left and right. It feel better. Now do the same on the capacitor,
moving to it by pressing cursor down and than adjusting value as for
the inductance.

Final values should be around 568nH and 408pF. Now you want to see
what happen using the closest standard commercial values, that is 560nH
and 390pF in the E12 series. Select (with Shift+Cursor Up), if needed, the
inductance and then press '=', the dialog window appear (middle line
is unused) and the string '560n s' has to be introduced. Next move to
capacitor (Shift+Curs Down) and pressing '=' here insert '390p p'. The
final result is of SWR=1.14, if it's enough for you...

Moving the mouse to the point where the two arcs ends you can see that
the point has an impedance of about 10+j20ohm.

Transmission line and resistor can be used similarly refer to the
section INTERACTIVE COMMANDS for knowing how they can be placed.
The major difference with transmission line is that they have two
parameter, the electrical length and the characteristic impedance: the
former can be adjusted with Shift+Cursor left/right as for resistor,
inductance and capacitor; the latter can be adjusted with Mod+cursor
left/right.

Now the network can be saved either in a
.B gsmc
format (.gdt extension) by pressing Ctrl+s or in spice format pressing
Ctrl+w:  The file so generated can be now analyzed with a spice simulator or
.B gnucap
or
.B ngspice
; maybe you are interested in simulating it sweeping around 15.5MHz,
so modify the line

	.ac lin 1  15.50MEG  15.50MEG

in 

	.ac lin 51  10MEG  30MEG

and run spice or
.B gnucap
.

This example should be included in gsmc package an can be retrieved by
pressing Ctrl+l and selecting example1.gdt.

Autotune algorithm is very primitive and may not reach what is very simple
to do by hand, do not ask to much from it, work in progress...

Charts so drawn can be printed to a Postscript or Encapsulated Postscript
file; in printed file some information are added on the chart drawing as well
as Circuit Description and some of the Current Value are transcripted.
Automatic recognition of filename extension .eps or .ps allows one to specify
if the file has to be in encapsulated format or not.

.SH FILES
.B gsmc
don't use special configuration file, a gtkrc file is supplied and can
be tuned to user preferences; if present it must be in /root/.gsmc/gtkrc.
File describing the network currently analyzed can be generated, it's
only needed that a minimum file permission is allowed, if not the
program will work but data could not be saved.

Data file (.gdt) contain a copy of internal data structures in a quite 
human readable format; by inspection one can recognize and modify some
parts using a text editor. For more details compare a .gdt file with 
smcdata struct defined in source file main.h.

.SH LIMITATIONS
Porting can be very very difficult, since all is based on X windows
programming and GTK library, but for other platform a plenty of
similar program are available, free and good one too.

.SH BUGS
Help me to find.

.SH TODO

.B \(bu
Improve autotune algorithm

.B \(bu
Target setting (not always one want to match to z0) for autotune.
