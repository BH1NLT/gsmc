.SH NAME
gsmc \- A GTK Smith Chart Calulator for RF impedance matching


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gsmc

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gsmc
is a GTK application that allow to do all the calculation usually done
on a Smith Chart.
It permits to make calculation for network composed by resistor,
capacitor, inductance, and trasmission line (also as stub).
Network topology is limitated to series, parallel and as trasmissive
for trasmission line. No series connection are allowed in parallel
branch, neither parallel connection in series branch.
Trasmission line can be placed as quadrupole or as a parallel or
series stub, either opened or shorted at the other end.

Calculation procedure starts with setting the initial impedance to be
matched, next network elements are added and tuned to obtain the
desidered impedance value.

The network so obtained can be saved in spice format for other analisys.

The initial (start) impedance is thought as "the load" so when
adding a trasmission line placed as a quadrupole rotation is
clockwise, going "toward generator"; generator is placed after the
last network element, as can be seen from spice output.

.SH INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
.B gsmc
is a menu based GTK application with as much as possible accelerators
and mnemonics. Nearly all the command can to be issued as a single
keystroke or keystroke with modifiers. This is, in the author's
opinion, the preferable way for very specialistic programs that has to
be used extensively.

.RE
.B "DIALOG WIN"

For operation that requires data entry a widget is created; it is
composed by an text entry field and optionaly some radio button to
chose the format of data entry.

The format for data entry can be a single number, or a more complex
string. First of all every number can be supplyed using standar prefix
for unit of measure i.e.:
.RS
.IP a
(atto) 1e-18
.IP f 
(femto) 1e-15
.IP p 
(pico) 1e-12
.IP n 
(nano) 1e-9
.IP u 
(micro) 1e-6
.IP m 
(milli) 1e-3
.IP k 
(kilo) 1e3
.IP M 
(mega) 1e6
.IP G 
(giga) 1e9
.IP T 
(tera) 1e12
.RE
Note that for spice output format mega is written as MEG instead of M,
that will be otherwise recognized by spice as milli.
Unit of measure are not allowed to be in the text entered.

Where a complex number is required both the rectangular and the polar
format are recognized: the former can be supplied as '12.3-j456m'
while the latter can be supplied as '34.2 145' meaning a modulus of
34.2 with a phase of 145 degrees. If the complex number is purely
immaginary only something like 'j82' can be supplied, while if
immaginary part is zero a single number can be given. Immaginary operator
can be issued as 'i' as well as 'j'.

.SH DATA PRESENTATION
The single window of
.B gsmc
is divided in four parts:
.TP
.BI \-
The Smith chart itself in the upper left portion, where arcs and
constant circle are drawn.

.TP
.BI \-
The vertical bar on the rigth of the Smith chart, where initial, final
and cursor impedance are presented togheter general data.

.TP
.BI \-
The horizontal bar on the bottom of Smith chart where the network
element are listed.

.TP
.BI \-
The portion in the lower right portion, for future use...


.SH EXAMPLE OF USE
Let's try a simple example to understand how
.B xsmc
work. Suppose to have a load of 10-j35ohm to be matched to 50+j0ohm at
an operating frequency of 15.5MHz and we can use only concentrated
reactive elements, i.e. inductances and capacitors.

So start with setting operating frequency: press 'f' and a dialog win
will appear. Type in the string '15.5M' and then press enter. Now in the
vertical bar the frequency entered is displayed.

Next set the start point impedance: press 's' and a dialog win will
appear with the title "Start Point"; select the format for start point
either clicking the "Z" radio buttono or using the menmonic via Mod+Z.
Now the impedance can be entered as the string '10-j35' followed by
enter. The starting point is now displayed as a small circle.


The network has now to be constructed: let start with a series
inductance of 800nH, so press 'l' and next introduce the value as
'800n', be sure that "Series" radio button is selected before pressing
enter. TAB and Shift+TAB is usefull to move across items in dialog win
without leave hands from keyboard.
This value is really too large, use Shft+Left cursor to reduce a
bit. Up to where? Let's help you displaing the admittance constant
circles pressing "Ctrl+2", the arc should arrive to the G=1 circle
(also called the mirror circle), it's arround 546nH.

Now add a capacitor in parallel connection, saying of 200pF: press 'c'
and insert the string '200p' and select Parallel either with mouse or
with "Mod+p". Now the admittance circles may confuse, remove it by
pressing "Ctrl+2" again. The value of 200pF is too small, enlarge it
by pressing Shift+Left cursor up to get the end point near to the
chart's center. The point reached with 429pF has nearly zero imaginary
but is 43ohm of real part instead of 50ohm.

So back to the inductance and try to modify it, with Shift+Cursor up
move to the first component and then try to change the inductance value by
pressing cursor left and right. The changes are too large and 50+j0
cannot be reached. So press "Mod+Cursor down" and the "tunestep" value shown
in the vertical bar is reduced from 10% to 5%, try again to use Shift+Curors
left and right. It feel better. Now do the same on the capacitor,
moving to it by pressing cursor down and than adjusting value as for
the inductance.

Final values should be arround 568nH and 408pF. Now you want to see
what appen using the closest standard commercial values, that is 560nH
and 390pF in the E12 series. Select (with Shift+Cursor Up), if needed, the
inductance and then press '=', the dialog window appear (middle line
is unused) and the string '560n s' has to be introduced. Next move to
capacitor (Shift+Curs Down) and pressing '=' here insert '390p p'. The
final result is of SWR=1.14, if it's enough for you...

Moving the mouse to the point where the two arcs ends you can see that
the point has an impedance of about 10+j20ohm.

Trasmission line and resistor can be used similary refer to the
section INTERACTIVE COMMANDS for knowing how they can be placed.
The major difference with transmission line is that they have two
parameter, the electrical lenght and the caracteristic impedance: the
former can be adjusted with Shift+Cursor left/rigth as for resistor,
inductance and capacitor; the latter can be adjusted with Mod+cursor
left/right.

Now the network can be saved pressing Ctrl+w: actually only spice format
is supported. The file so generated can be now analized with a spice
simulator or
.B gnucap
; maybe you are interested in simulating it sweeping arround 15.5MHz,
so modify the line

	.ac lin 1  15.50MEG  15.50MEG

in 

	.ac lin 51  10MEG  30MEG

and run spice or
.B gnucap
.

.SH FILES
.B gsmc
don't use special configuration file, a gtkrc file is supplied and can
be tuned to user preferences; if present it must be in /root/.gsmc/gtkrc.
File describing the network currently analized can be generated, it's
only needed that a minimum file permission is allowed, if not the
program will work but data could not be saved.

.SH LIMITATIONS
Porting can be very very difficult, since all is based on X windows
programming and GTK library, but for other platform a plenty of
similar program are available, free and good one too.

.SH BUGS
Help me to find.

.SH TODO

.B \(bu
Target settting (not alwais one want to match to z0) for autotune.

.B \(bu
Auxiliary window for error reporting instead of stderr.
